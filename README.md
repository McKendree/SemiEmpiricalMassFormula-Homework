Program 1:
run SemiEmpiricalMassFormula_Assignment.py by executing python SemiEmpiricalMassFormula_Assignment.py. This will print the results of question 1, parts a-e, with each result labeled beforehand by the question part letter.

Program 2:
run int_error.py by executing python int_error.py. This will print the results of question 2, part a. In answer to the question asked in this part, the numbers can be calculated without the program just by finding 2 to the power of the number of bits, divided by two if it includes negatives.

Program 3:
run float_error.py by executing python float_error.py. This will print the results of question 2, part b. In answer to the question asked in this part, numbers of wildly different magnitudes may need to be added or subtracted from each other when dealing with different types of forces such as gravity and electromagnetism since gravity is many orders of magnitude weaker.

Program 4:
run float_compare.py by executing python float_compare.py. This will print an error message due to the function bad_float_compare being used, but if the first assert statement is removed, the function good_float_compare will be used instead, and no error message will be produced.
